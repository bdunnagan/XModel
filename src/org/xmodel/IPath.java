 * This interface represents a pre-compiled path through the domain object tree. The path consists
 * of a sequence of <i>location steps</i> as defined by the X-Path 1.0 specification.

 * <b>Note:</b> When an IPathListener is added to an IPath, it is associated to a particular
 * instance of IContext. Currently, IContext cannot be modified and therefore the association
 * assumes that the context position and size will not change. If the context position or size does
 * change, it is the responsibility of the client to reinstall the listener with the correct
 * IContext.
